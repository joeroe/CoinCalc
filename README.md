This R package provides six function allowing for the application of Event Coincidence Analysis for event (time) series.

This repository is a fork of CoinCalc 2.0 (<https://github.com/JonatanSiegmund/CoinCalc>) which has been restructured to allow it to be cloned and installed more easily.
The functionality is otherwise unchanged.

## Installation
